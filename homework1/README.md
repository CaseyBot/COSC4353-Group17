# Homework 1 - due 2/6

1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)


2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)  
	The development methodology we will be using is the incremental development method. This will fit our purposes greatly considering the nature of this assignment and the way it is being presented. Beginning with the first assignment, we will be incrementally adding to our software application until the end of the semester in which we will have the finished product. This methodology is beneficial because we can use the increments to sufficiently test each aspect of the program to ensure that there is a low risk for product failure. 

3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)


4. IMPORTANT: list who did what within the group. TAs should be able to validate in GitHub, otherwise team members who didn't contribute will receive a ZERO.
